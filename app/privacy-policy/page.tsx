              of your data, contact us using the information provided below.
              We may verify your identity using the information you

              another person, documentation confirming your authorization
              may be required.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>
              We retain personal information only for as long as reasonably
              necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Policy,

            <h2>8. Children&apos;s Privacy</h2>
            <p>
              Certain forms on the Site may request information about a
              child, such as name or date of birth, provided by a parent or
              legal guardian. We do not knowingly collect personal
              information directly from children under the age of 13
              without verifiable parental consent, consistent with the
              Children&apos;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
            </p>
            <p>
              If you believe we have collected information about a child in
              violation of this Policy, please contact us. After
              verification, we will promptly remove the data from our
              records.
            </p>

            <h2>9. Data Security</h2>
            <p>
              We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards
              designed to protect personal data from unauthorized access,
              misuse, or disclosure. These safeguards may include encrypted
              data transmission and storage, secure server infrastructure,
              access restrictions, role-based permissions, and routine
              security reviews.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite these protections, no internet transmission or
              electronic storage system can be guaranteed to be completely
              secure. Users should also take steps to protect their
              personal information.
            </p>

            <h2>10. Automated Processing</h2>
            <p>
              Limited automated processing tools may be used to enhance the
              Site and user experience. These may include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Displaying advertising based on previous browsing behavior</li>
              <li>Using analytics to improve how services are presented</li>
              <li>Automatically filtering messages or submissions to identify spam or misuse</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              These processes do not make legally binding decisions or
              prevent access to the Site. Where applicable by law, you may
              request human review of decisions made solely through
              automated processing.
            </p>

            <h2>11. Do Not Track Signals</h2>
            <p>
              Some web browsers offer a &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; (DNT)
              setting intended to signal a user&apos;s tracking preferences
              across websites. At this time, our Site does not respond to
              DNT signals due to the absence of a universally accepted
              standard. We may revisit this approach as industry practices
              and regulatory guidance evolve.
            </p>

            <h2>12. Accessibility</h2>
            <p>
              We aim to make our Privacy Policy accessible to all users,
              including individuals with disabilities. If you need this
              policy provided in an alternative format such as large print,
              audio, or simplified language, or if you encounter
              accessibility barriers while using our Site, please contact
              us. We will make reasonable efforts to accommodate
              accessibility requests.
            </p>

            <h2>13. Manage Cookie Preferences</h2>
            <p>
              You may control your cookie preferences through your browser
              settings or by using our cookie consent tool (when available).
              These tools may allow you to accept or reject certain
              non-essential cookies and modify preferences at any time
              through a banner or footer link.
            </p>
            <p>
              Essential cookies necessary for core Site functionality may
              remain active even if other cookies are disabled.
            </p>

            <h2>14. Updates to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>
              We may revise this Privacy Policy periodically. Any updates
              will be posted on this page and will include an updated Last
              Updated date indicating when the most recent changes were
              made.
            </p>

            <h2>15. SMS Communications</h2>

            <p>
              You may opt out at any time by replying STOP, or request
              assistance by replying HELP.
